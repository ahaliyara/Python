# ▶️ 1. Creating Variables and Assigning Values
name = "Abdulrahim"
age = 35
height = 1.75  # in meters
is_student = False

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Is student:", is_student)

# ✅ Task 1: Create variables for your city (string), number of kids (int), and has_pet (boolean)
city = "Vancouver"
num_kids = 2
has_pet = True


print("\nYour city:", city)
print("Number of kids:", num_kids)
print("Has pet:", has_pet)

# ▶️ 2. Reassigning Variables
age = 36  # Happy birthday!
print("\nNew age after birthday:", age)

# ✅ Task 3: Calculate the age your kids will be in 5 years and print
kids_age_in_5_years = num_kids + 5  # Assuming num_kids is the total number, change logic as needed
print("Kids' age in 5 years (assuming starting age = num_kids):", kids_age_in_5_years)
